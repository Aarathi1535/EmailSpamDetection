# Email Spam Detector
In this Machine Learning application, the user can predict whether the mail they have entered is spam or not. It helps the user to easily segregate the mail into spam or non-spam category to avoid any further disturbance.
- Loading the CSV file
- Reading the dataset i.e csv file
- Segregating the input and output variables, where the mail message enetered becomes the input and output displayed is spam or ham
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets
- Using Naive Bayes Classifier algorithm, Count Vectorizer and Pipeline concepts to train the data and build a machine learning model.
  In this stage of algorithm the model receives the textual information i.e categorical values and converts them into binary information. 
- Lastly, displaying the output i.e Spam or Ham
